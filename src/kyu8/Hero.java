he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons!
each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry..
Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets
and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)*/
